        Cheap 433 MHz RF relay modules are often advertised as supporting ON/OFF (interlock / latched) mode.
        In practice, this mode frequently fails when used with the included remote control.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This case explains the real cause of the issue and demonstrates a simple hardware-level fix that restores
        proper ON/OFF operation using a single remote.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          According to the documentation, the relay supports interlock (latched) mode, where:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>the first button turns the relay ON</li>
          <li>the second button turns the relay OFF</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, when attempting to program this mode, the learning process fails. Both buttons behave identically,
          making correct ON/OFF operation impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toggle mode works as expected, which often leads to the assumption that the relay or firmware is defective.

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>Practical testing shows that:</p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>the receiver correctly supports interlock mode</li>
          <li>the learning procedure is performed correctly</li>
          <li>both buttons on the remote trigger the same action</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This indicates that the issue is not related to receiver memory, firmware, or learning sequence.

        <h2>Root Cause</h2>
        <p>Opening the remote control reveals the actual cause.</p>
        <p>
          Both buttons on the PCB are routed to the same microcontroller input. The board uses 0 ohm resistors
          as configuration jumpers, and in the factory configuration both buttons share a single signal path.
        </p>
        <p>As a result:</p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>both buttons generate the same RF code</li>
          <li>the receiver cannot distinguish between ON and OFF commands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is a hardware configuration choice, not a firmware limitation.
        </p>

        <h2>Fix</h2>
        <p>
          The PCB is a universal design that supports multiple routing options.
        </p>
        <p>By relocating a 0 ohm jumper to an alternative position:</p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>each button is connected to a separate MCU input</li>
          <li>the remote starts generating two distinct RF codes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No firmware changes are required.</p>
        <p>No modification of the receiver is necessary.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>After the jumper reconfiguration:</p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>interlock (latched) mode programs successfully</li>
          <li>one button reliably turns the relay ON</li>
          <li>the second button reliably turns the relay OFF</li>
          <li>a single remote works exactly as described in the documentation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This case highlights a common pattern in low-cost electronics:</p>
        <ul class="list-tight">
          <li>documentation often describes an ideal configuration</li>
          <li>shipped hardware may use cost-saving shortcuts</li>
          <li>many "firmware bugs" are actually PCB routing decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this case, the receiver worked correctly from the start. The limitation was entirely inside the remote control hardware.
